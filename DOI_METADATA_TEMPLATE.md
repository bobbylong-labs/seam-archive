# DOI Metadata Template  
  
This template defines the minimal metadata required for Zenodo DOIs  
associated with releases of the `seam-archive` repository.  
  
## Core Fields (per release)  
  
- Title:  
- Description:  
- Creators:  
  - Name:  
  - Affiliation:  
  - ORCID (if available):  
- License:  
- Version:  
- Release date:  
- Related identifier (GitHub release URL):  
- Keywords:  
  - GPT-4  
  - GPT-5  
  - GPT-5.1  
  - language models  
  - historical archive  
  
## Usage Rules  
  
- This file is a template only; it is never edited to describe a specific release.  
- Each new release copies this template into Zenodo’s metadata form.  
- Once a release is published and a DOI is minted, its metadata is not changed.
