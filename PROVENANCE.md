# Provenance Anchor  

This repository serves as a historical archive of model interaction transcripts spanning GPT-4 → GPT-5 → GPT-5.1.  

This document anchors the provenance chain by establishing:  
- Identity consistency (owner: bobbylong-labs)  
- Timestamp integrity (file creation time of this commit)  
- Structural immutability of top-level directories  
- Version lineage constraints (no content rewriting, no retroactive editing)  

This file marks the initialization of the archive's integrity layer. All future additions must preserve the chain.
