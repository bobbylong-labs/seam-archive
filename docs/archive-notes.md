# Archive Notes  
This repository preserves historical interaction data from earlier generations of large language models (GPT-4 through GPT-5.1).  
Scope:  
- Unedited transcript excerpts  
- High-level notes on behavioral shifts between versions  
- Context needed to interpret the raw material (time period, model versions, interaction setup)  
Guiding principles:  
- Preserve evidence as it was produced  
- Avoid coining new terminology  
- Keep transcripts separate from descriptive notes
